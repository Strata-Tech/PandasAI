Pandas AI is an innovative framework built on top of the Pandas library, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Pandas AI has the ability to transform data analysis by leveraging large language models to derive insights from datasets. While data scientists often spend a substantial amount of time cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data, Pandas AI automates many of these tedious activities. 

I have created an App using Pandas AI and Open AI with streamlit integration to allow users to interact with datasets. Users can summarize pandas data frames data by using natural language. Moreover, you can use it to plot complex visualisation, manipulate data-frames, and generate business insights. 

 I'm also exploring how to utilize private LLMs, which could offer increased data privacy and security.
